# Visual Studio Code for ValueEdge

With the ValueEdge Visual Studio Code plugin, you can do your ValueEdge work (on stories, defects, tasks, and so on) directly within the Visual Studio Code development framework.

## Description

Using the plugin, developers can connect to an ValueEdge workspace, view ValueEdge items, and make updates.

The plugin supports two-way integration:
- The plugin shows work item data from ValueEdge in VS Code;
- Changes made in VS Code impact data in ValueEdge.

## Minimum requirements

- VS Code version: 1.56.0 or later.
